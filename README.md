# Ping-Pong-Game

Ping Pong game is one of the first computer games ever made; it’s a simple “tennis-like” game with two paddles and a ball, with the goal of defeating your opponent.

## Primary Points

-The screen will have two rods at the **top** and **bottom**.
-Same keys will be used to operate both rods. To put it another way, they will move in **sync**.
-When the game begins, an alert about the greatest score and the player who achieved it should be displayed. If no such record exists, state that – this is your first time.
-Save the name and max-score in **local storage** if the score becomes the highest.
-When a player wins a round, an alert will appear on the screen, displaying the victorious player’s name and score.

## Game Rules

-When the **Enter** key is pushed, the round should begin. ( You can also use another key )
-The **arrow-right** and **arrow-left** keys will only move the rods horizontally. ( You can also use other keys )
-The ball will be given to the losing rod for the next match, and the rods and ball will be moved to the **centre**.
-Starting from the first match, the score will be kept track of.
